# Market campaign analysis using A/B test

A/B Testing is a technique used to compare two variants of a variable.

Often, this is employed to determine whether one variant performs better than the other by splitting our users into two groups: one that receives the treatment (receives the email about the new campaign) and one that does not.

A/B testing is an essential of digital strategy, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on real user data. By optimizing digital experiences through A/B testing, companies can enhance user engagement, increase conversion rates, and ultimately drive business growth.
